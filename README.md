This is the Official Russian Translation of Noble Fates. New strings will be added here when the game receives updates.

# Contributing to an Official Translation
Fork the translation's repository.

Sync when new strings are added to add them to your translation (recommend using Branch -> Update from upstream/main in Github windows client). 

Create Pull Requests with your changes. 

Key Contributors have the opportunity to earn the ability to Moderate the Fork for that language.

# Testing a Translation
You can Test changes to a translation by adding it as a local mod.

Create a new folder under ```%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Xobermon, LLC\Noble Fates\Mods``` with the name you'd like.

Drop the game.loc file into that folder.

Add a Localization.octdat file with the following contents to replace an existing translation:
```
{
    id Oct.Localization.Languages.Russian
    type LocalizationLanguage
    appendonly
    
    files = 
    [
        $clear
        \game.loc
    ]
}
```

When you run the game, your translations should take effect when you switch to Русский.

# Translation Mods
Translation Mods that add new languages or extend existing ones are supported. Create a mod using the steps above under Testing a Translation, only adding a new Language instead of extending an existing one.

When satisfied, feel free to upload your mod to the Workshop from the Mod Menu in-game.

## Notes
Strings that are Untranslated will return the English Version. String Pools support any number of translations greater than 0. If no translations are provided, the English strings will be used. Blank Translations are treated as no translation.

If the English string doesn't contain a variable and it isn't listed in the Translation Notes, then it probably isn't available. Do what you can with what's available.

Generally, we do not translate unit abbreviations in the game - so p (Prestige), t (Trait Points), c (Coins), y (Yir), d (Day), h (Hour), m (Minute), n (Nutrition) are intentionally left untranslated.

The game has grammatical issues in English via limitations of its technology and attempts at humor. These are intentional, and it's likely that there will be more or less of them in each language. When writing text, we prioritize information delivery and tone over grammatical correctness.

.Advanced Strings signify places where we've made advances in the tech under the hood to allow for more nuance in translations. Generally these will be marked Optional and the strings they replace are marked Deprecated. It's only necessary to translate the Optional or Deprecated string and its children. We prefer using the .Advanced version for all new translations.

### .con Function
.con is a Conjugation function that conjugates between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person depending on who the speaker and listener are relative to the character. These can be nested.

### .mf/.mfn Functions
These functions allow the substitution of Masculine, Feminine, or Neutral variants of Text based on the gender of the character (or string) before them.
